## Project Objectives

### Short Description
This project aims to analyze potential salary disparities among data science professionals in the United States. We explore various factors such as total yearly compensation, years of experience, and gender to understand the dynamics contributing to salary variations.

### Methods Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analysis

### Platforms/Languages
- R
- Markdown

## Project Description

### Research Questions
1. Is there a salary disparity among different regions in the United States?
2. What is the association between years of experience and total compensation, considering gender?
3. How does the cost of living index relate to salary disparities?

### Methods and Techniques
- Boxplots and Density Plots for visualizing salary distribution
- Scatterplots to explore the relationship between experience and compensation
- Bar plots for comparing cost of living index by region

### Challenges
- Missing education data limiting a comprehensive analysis
- Limited gender data affecting gender-related inquiries

### Next Steps (Future Directions)
1. Address missing data through external sources or imputation techniques.
2. Investigate the impact of education on salary disparities.
3. Explore additional demographic factors influencing compensation.
4. Enhance visualizations for more insightful analysis.
